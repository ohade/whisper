## Work Log

### Playwright Test for Calendar Recording Functionality - 2025-05-08
**Accomplishments:**
- Created comprehensive Playwright test that validates calendar recording functionality
- Implemented mocking approach to avoid microphone permission issues
- Validated recording appearance in sidebar
- Verified red dot indicator in calendar
- Tested popup menu display and closing behavior

**Challenges:**
- Initial approach using actual microphone recording caused test to hang due to permission prompts
- TypeScript errors with window object properties in the test code
- Running tests required careful handling to avoid user interference

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Used JavaScript injection to mock recordings instead of actual microphone usage
- Added TypeScript ignore comments to handle window object property access
- Created screenshots at key test points for visual verification
- Implemented proper test cleanup to ensure test repeatability
