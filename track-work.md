## Work Log

### Save Button Fix - 2025-05-09
**Accomplishments:**
- Fixed the issue where save buttons required two clicks to send recordings for transcription
- Implemented proper handling of MediaRecorder's asynchronous behavior in both main and continuation recording components
- Added immediate UI feedback when saving recordings
- Improved error handling for cases with no recorded audio
- Ensured consistent state management across recording components

**Challenges:**
- MediaRecorder's asynchronous nature meant that stopping recording and getting the audio data are separate events
- The original implementation didn't account for the delay between stopping recording and data becoming available
- Needed to ensure proper state management to prevent duplicate audio chunks
- Had to maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Created a Promise-based approach to wait for the 'dataavailable' event after stopping recording
- Added an isSaving flag to prevent duplicate audio chunks from being processed
- Modified event listeners to properly handle the asynchronous flow
- Added proper error handling and UI feedback throughout the save process
- Ensured the isSaving flag is reset in all code paths (success, error, and early returns)

**Completed: 2025-05-09 01:34:15**

### Continue Recording Component Refactoring - 2025-05-09
**Accomplishments:**
- Refactored the continue recording component to match the original recording component's functionality and appearance
- Updated the UI to provide consistent language selection between original and continuation modes
- Fixed the timer display to show correct recording time in continuation mode
- Improved the pause/resume functionality to work consistently in continuation mode
- Enhanced the animation and transitions when canceling or completing continuation recording
- Added proper cleanup when switching between recording modes

**Challenges:**
- Needed to ensure consistent UI behavior between original and continuation recording components
- Had to handle different states (recording, paused, stopped) correctly in both modes
- Ensuring proper timer synchronization between components
- Managing the cleanup of UI elements when switching modes or canceling recordings

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Created a dedicated setContinuationLanguage function to handle language selection consistently
- Updated the toggleContinuationRecording function to properly handle UI updates
- Modified the stopRecording and pauseRecording functions to check for continuation mode
- Created a separate saveContinuationRecording function to handle the continuation-specific logic
- Added smooth animations for better user experience when transitioning between states
- Implemented proper error handling and notifications throughout the continuation flow

**Completed: 2025-05-09 00:02:06**

### Continue Recording System Improvements - 2025-05-08
**Accomplishments:**
- Added language selection (Hebrew/English) to the continue recording interface
- Fixed issue where continuing recording created a new record instead of appending to the current one
- Wrote unit tests for the continue recording functionality
- Implemented proper UI feedback when continuing recordings
- Added CSS styling for the language selection in the continuation container

**Challenges:**
- The continue recording function was defaulting to English without giving users a language choice
- Each continued recording was creating a new entry instead of appending to the current transcription
- Needed to ensure the UI properly reflected the continuation state
- Had to handle different action button states between normal and continuation modes

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Added a language selection component to the continuation container with proper styling
- Modified the saveRecording function to detect continuation mode and append to existing records
- Added server communication to include continuation mode information in API requests
- Updated the UI to show clear feedback when continuing recordings
- Implemented proper cleanup of continuation container after saving

**Completed: 2025-05-08 23:42:41**

### Playwright Test for Calendar Recording Functionality - 2025-05-08
**Accomplishments:**
- Created comprehensive Playwright test that validates calendar recording functionality
- Implemented mocking approach to avoid microphone permission issues
- Validated recording appearance in sidebar
- Verified red dot indicator in calendar
- Tested popup menu display and closing behavior

**Challenges:**
- Initial approach using actual microphone recording caused test to hang due to permission prompts
- TypeScript errors with window object properties in the test code
- Running tests required careful handling to avoid user interference

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Used JavaScript injection to mock recordings instead of actual microphone usage
- Added TypeScript ignore comments to handle window object property access
- Created screenshots at key test points for visual verification
- Implemented proper test cleanup to ensure test repeatability

**Completed: 2025-05-08 22:15:48**
